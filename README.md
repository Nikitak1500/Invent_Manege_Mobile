Mobile application for inventory management during a move â€“ Developed for my first practice with Android. The application is made in Java. Libraries used include Picasso for images and ZXing for generating and reading QR codes. I learned the basics of creating Android applications and working with libraries. Later, interaction with the server was added using the Retrofit library.
